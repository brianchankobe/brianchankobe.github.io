Chapter 5 - Project 2

Project 2: book rep Customer relations Management 
DifficuLty LEvEL: Intermediate

Overview

Demonstrate your proficiency with absolute positioning and floats by modifying chapter05-project02.css 
so that chapter05-project02.html looks similar to that shown in Figure 5.39.

Instructions

1. Examine chapter05-project01.html in the browser. The HTML does not need to be modified for this project.

2. You will create the three-column layout using absolute positioning and margin settings as described in Section 5.4.1.

3. Within the main column, the company and client addresses will use floats rather than positioning.

4. Within the boxes for recent messages, weekly changes, and top sellers, you will need to use floats, 
block display, and padding values.

Testing

1. Be sure to test by increasing/decreasing the browser zoom level. If you have used em units for font 
sizes and most margin and padding values, it should scale to the different zoom levels.
