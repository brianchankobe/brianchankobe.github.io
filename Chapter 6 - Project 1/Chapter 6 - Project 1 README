Project 1: Simple login Form prevalidation
DifficuLty LEvEL: Beginner

Overview

You will create JavaScript prevalidation for the form in Chapter06-project01.html. 
This project builds on Chapter 4 Project 3 (the Photo sharing site upload form).

Instructions

1. You will need to link to an external JavaScript file in the head of the page so that you can write code in its own file.

2. You should define a CSS style to use when highlighting a blank field.

3. Set up a listener on the formâ€™s submit event so that the code prevents submission
of the form (preventDefault()) if either the title or description field is left blank
or the accept license box is not checked, but otherwise submits the form.

4. Enhance the JavaScript so that blank fields trigger a change in the appearance
of the form (using the style defined earlier).

5. Add another listener to the fields so that when the user types into a field
(changed event) JavaScript removes the red color you just added.

Test

1. Test the form in the browser. Try submitting the form with either field blank. 
You should see the field highlighted and notice the page will not be refreshed as shown in Figure 6.21.

2. Type into one of the highlighted fields, and the error color should be immediately removed.
